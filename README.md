# Chive Mobile Application - Backend

This project is a hybrid mobile application for both iOS and Android devices developed with Ionic 3 and the MEAN Stack. The app is a recipe book which allows users to store their recipes safely on their devices.

## Introduction
**Chive** is the end of year project developed by myself and [Keith Daly](https://github.com/dalykeith) for our third year of Software Development in GMIT. The app itself is a recipe collection app. The aim of this project was to use knowledge collected over our last three years in college and apply it to learning a suite of new technologies. Primarly the *MEAN stack*, comprised of **MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js** and **Node.js**. There are two parts to **Chive**, the frontend mobile application developed in *Ionic* and the backend with a common *RESTful API*.


## Prerequisites 

*Assumes that NodeJS is installed on your system*

**Download NodeJS:**

## How to Run The Backend

**No Setup Required**

The server, RESTful API and MongoDB are all currently hosted on Heroku.

In order to run the frontend continue to https://github.com/dalykeith/chive-mobile-application to see steps on how.


## Planning

When deciding which technologies to use for the backend we were set on learning the MEAN stack. We were both highly inexperienced with NodeJS and the Javascript Frameworks and were determined to learn what goes into designing a fullstack application.
